# May God be glorified in all things!

Since we are closed community, we perform our activities in the exterior and the interior of the
Monastery - the common prayers performed seven times per day, which are followed by the personal
prayers. Lectio Divina (contemplative reading of the Holly Bible), which is available to believers
once per week as well.

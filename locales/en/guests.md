The modern world is afflicted by a lack of spiritual light; it is often deformed, unbalanced and
without beauty. In such a world people easily lose their way and do not know how to find
answers to their questions about the search for meaning in their lives, for love and happiness.

The Benedictine monastery is the sisters’ home, but it is also meant to be a house of God in the
midst of this world. For that reason this monastery is open for every person in need, for
everyone who is willing to look for answers and open to accepting the truth. The monastery is
thus an island of peace surrounded by the stormy seas of the modern world – it is a lighthouse
illuminating people’s lives.

The monastery welcomes those who desire to deepen their relationship with God, to participate
in our liturgy, to talk or to rest in silence.

With God´s help and through our benefactors we succeeded in finishing the guest house. The
finished parts of the monastery are already open to welcome incoming visitors.

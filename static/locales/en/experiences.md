### Nela

> “It was by the God´s will that I discovered the way to the Monastery in Horné Orešany...the will
> that literally saved my life... I was exhausted and overwhelmed - the time pressure,
> ever-present stress and requirements... My values vs today´s way of living have resulted to many
> questions I wasn´t able to answer... The Monastery is the true place of life-giving words and
> answers! Every time I come to this wonderful place, I find peace and joy! I have the courage to
> go to the world and to share the God´s message – the patient and kind love to the others! Thank
> you so much for everything!”

### Kristína

> “At one moment in my life I had to realise there is no life without unexpected changes, problems,
> joy and troubles. So my life&#39;s goal became to look for the right peace, regardless of the
> situation I find myself in. The one who has promised this type of peace to everyone is Jesus.
> I ofen miss this peace and I feel fear and anxiety also because I don´t live the real
> relationship with the one who can give that peace to me. I visited the Nouns in Oresany to
> deepen / start building my relationship with Jesus. The sisters invited me to the catechesis
> they organized. To be honest, the lectures are amazing, I eat it and they gently help me to
> compose the mosaic of sense of my life.”

### Michaela

> “When I heard about the Monastery in Orešany 1st time, I didn&#39;t want to go there. But I
> changed my mind when I heard stories and experiences of my friends. &quot;Time at abbey&quot;
> was very special. I had a big fight in my heart and I didn&#39;t understand it. It is such a
> peaceful place. Lectures are very interesting and awesome. I would love people to have same
> opportunity to hear these topics at church. Let priests preaches about them... Thanks to God for
> these nuns :) Nuns are awesome, very kind, they love to laugh and they are (or some of them)
> very good cook. I love to know them the other way as &quot;this world&quot; think about them -
> as a sanctified in a skirt, who just pray on knees.”

### Darina

> “These times are still more and more marked by the indifference to God´s existence, to the Word
> of God, and to all religion as such. Therefore, I am grateful to God that I have the grace to
> take part in the spiritual sessions in the Monastery of the Most Holy Mother of God in Horne
> Orešany where I can fully and actively perceive God´s presence, infinite love, and
> re-discovering God&#39;s message of salvation!”

### Jana

> “The presentation regarding the “Art of Distinction” I took part in the
> Monastery in Horne Oresany was exactly what I needed to hear at that moment of my life! I was
> surprised by the depth of the analysis of the short part selected from the Bible (Gn 1, 1-5),
> which we explained in a wonderful way - sentence by sentence... Despite the fact that the Book
> of Genesis belongs to my favourite ones, I´ve never realized the messages so important for my
> life hidden in these sentences! Very useful were also the self-assessment exercises. Thanks for
> this incredible experience!”
